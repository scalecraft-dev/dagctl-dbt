                      The number of pods which reached phase Succeeded.
                      The value increases monotonically for a given spec. However, it may
                      decrease in reaction to scale down of elastic indexed jobs.

                      The number of pods which are terminating (in phase Pending or Running
                      and have a deletionTimestamp).

                      This field is beta-level. The job controller populates the field when
                      the feature gate JobPodReplacementPolicy is enabled (enabled by default).

                      uncountedTerminatedPods holds the UIDs of Pods that have terminated but
                      the job controller hasn't yet accounted for in the status counters.

                      The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates
                      (succeeded or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it
                      in the job status:

                      1. Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field.
                      2. Remove the pod finalizer.
                      3. Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the corresponding
                          counter.

                      Old jobs might not be tracked using this field, in which case the field
                      remains null.
                      The structure is empty for finished jobs.

                            UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                            don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                            intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.
